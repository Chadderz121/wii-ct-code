BAD1 is the section responsible for editing the game in the CT-CODE extension.

BAD1 is broken into three parts:
    BAD1CODE - The code segment for BAD1.
    BAD1DATA - The data segment for BAD1.
    tex0     - The data necessary to generate the texture with BAD1 embedded.

BAD1DATA is kept in a fairly simple archive format, which tagged components
inside it. Each of these components has a corresponding piece of code inside
BAD1CODE to process it. The tags to date are:
    MOD1 - Patches to apply to main.dol and the early memory.
    MOD2 - Patches to apply to StaticR.rel.
    CRS1 - List of courses to replace the default tables.
    CUP1 - List of cups to replace the default tables.
    OVR1 - Adds a 'speedometer' to the game in single player.
