OVR1 is a speedometer. This is a rather hacky piece of code; it latches into
the game's draw method and directly alters the screen buffer. The code is split
into overlay.s which is generic screen code and ctgp_overlay.s which is logic
specific to rendering a speedometer. In practice, we can't render many more than
about 160 by 40 pixels before visual artifacts are seen due to lag.

The .dds files are the images used by OVR1. These were edited in Paint .Net
which is one of the only programs that can process these files. The dimensions
MUST not change and the pixel format MUST be RGBA32 in the current code. Editing
the code may enable you to support other dimensions/formats.
