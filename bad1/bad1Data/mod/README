One of the lovely things about the CT-CODE engine is its MOD engine. This
allows us to arbitrarily patch the game's memory at three points:

    MOD0 - prior to execution of the entry point.
    MOD1 - when the health and safety screen is first loaded.
    MOD2 - when the health and safety screen fades.

MOD0 is stored inside the modified main.dol file, making it inconvenient to
edit. For this reason, all it does is make the patches needed to run MOD1 and
MOD2. MOD1 runs before the file StaticR.rel is loaded, making it a good time to
copy in large sections of code to fixed addresses, and patch main.dol itself.
MOD2 runs after StaticR.rel is loaded, making it good for patching this file.
Unfortunately, for simplicity, MOD2 remains in memory prementantly. Therefore
we want to make it as small as possible, so anything which can be done in MOD1
should be. MOD1 is only in memory while the health and safety screen is
displayed.

MOD0 is part of BAD0, so this folder only controls MOD1 and MOD2. Each of the
.mod files in this directory is processed by commands in makefile.mk to
assemble and format the patches correctly. The syntax of each line of the .mod
files is:
MOD_DOL(<id>, <address>, <code>)
or
MOD_REL(<id>, <address>, <code>)

MOD_DOL causes the ppc asm <code> to be copied to <address> as part of MOD1.
MOD_REL causes the ppc asm <code> to be copied to <address> as part of MOD2.
In both cases, <id> is a friendly name. /* */ comments are recognised.
ALL LINES OF ASSEMBLY CODE MUST END IN ;
Due to the adhoc nature of this build system, syntax errors are poorly reported.
