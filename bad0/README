BAD0 is the section responsible for loading BAD1 in the CT-CODE extension.

BAD0 is broken into two parts:
	BAD0CODE - The code segment for BAD0.
	BAD0DATA - The data segment for BAD0.

BAD0DATA is kept in a fairly simple archive format, which tagged components
inside it. Each of these components has a corresponding piece of code inside
BAD0CODE to process it. The tags to date are:
	MOD0 - Patches to apply to main.dol and the early memory to load BAD1.
