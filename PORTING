CT-CODE has been ported to RMCE, RMCJ and RMCP. Other Mario Kart regions can be
easily supported. A linker script of symbol definitions is required (like
rmcp.ld). Then an additional rule or two is necessary in the top level
Makefile, copying from the template of the others. The rest of the build system
is region agnostic.

Porting the basic structure to other games would not be impossible. The basic
architecture of BAD0 in main.dol loading a texture containing BAD1 on the 
health and safety screen should be almost universal. Port addresses would have
be updated in the region agnostic link script (rmc.ld) as well as the region
sepcific ones. Deleting some of the make rules in BAD1 should disable all the
Mario Kart specific logic, but the MOD1 & MOD2 sections should still prove
useful (if not their contents).
